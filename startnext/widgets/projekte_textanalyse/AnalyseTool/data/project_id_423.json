After living in London for many years, in 2004 we decided to move back to Barcelona (Spain). We started an online community for Spanish filmmakers 'Filmutea.com', which today, has over 40,000 registered users. Later, in 2007, we decided to make it a new generation production company, which among other things manages the community; and in 2009, we started developing our first feature film, 'Panzer Chocolate'.\n"],"keywords":["Horror","Transmedia"],"teaser_sound":""}],"status":0}
